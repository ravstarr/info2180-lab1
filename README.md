This is Lab 1 for Ravaughn Marsh

## Branching

Branching allows you to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch (usually called master), and can have multiple other branches.

## Web Development

I enjoy web development because it allows me to create interactive and dynamic user experiences. It's a perfect blend of creativity and technical problem-solving that I find very fulfilling. I especially love seeing my code come to life in the browser, creating websites that people can use and enjoy.
